          The project is ongoing, with new data being pulled in from multiple
          sources for different time periods.  I am starting as early back as I
          have good data for and working forward. Please keep checking back for
          new data to see how it evolves!
        </p>  
          <p>
          I am always looking for fellow appreciators of history interested in
          contributing to the project, whether that be via tracking down
          sources, pulling those into the map, or just suggestions. Get more
          info and reach out on the project's github by "opening an issue"! 
          <br>Or if you want to just be notified when I publish a notable amount of new content, send me an email at <a href="bfhouseiii@gmail.com">bfhouseiii@gmail.com</a>

          The Hornets Nest Evolution Project (HNEP) is a (presently solo)
          Citizen lead, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) project dedicated
          to digitizing the historical evolution of Mecklenburg County, and
          surrounding areas, via physical infrastructure, primarily roads and
          railways, and other traces left in the present.

          You can also support by buying me a coffee. As a token of gratitude I
          will prioritize researching a neighborhood of your choice, providing a
          quick report about it, and adding an info point crediting you as a
          patron
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you in advance for any and all support, even if it is just
          admiring the hidden history of Charlotte!
