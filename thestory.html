      <h2>The (abbreviated) story of Charlotte and its Roads</h2>
      <p>Before European Settlers arrived, this region was inhabited by several different Native american Tribes, notably the Catwaba tribe, along with the Cherokee and the Iroquois. 
        <br>Sugar(Or Sugaw as some spell it) creek is actually an Catawaban word, that translates to "Group of Huts".  Charlotte's center is located at the junction of 2 trading paths, which formed the track for Trade and Tryon in uptown, and is the reason for the grid being oriented roughly parallel to Sugar and Irwin Creeks   </p>
      <p>Charlotte was founded in the 1760s by  Thomas Polk, John Frohock and Abraham Alexander who purchased 360 acres of land from Lord Augustus Selwyn, upon which the heart of Charlotte sites 
        <br> Polk had a grid 400 ft on a side surveyed out on that plot, to form the starter of the town, named Charlottetown, or Charlottesburg, in honor of Queen Charlotte. Mecklenburg is a reference to the German county in which she was born. </p>
        
        <p>There was a gold rush in the region starting in 1803 , in particular in Cabarrus county, where Reed's gold mine operated as the countries first gold mine. Several mines were also opened in the Charlotte area, in particular where South end now sits.<br>
        This brought a branch of the US Mint in 1837 who minted that gold(along with other metals) into currency. The orginal mint sat on Mint st and Trade St. it was Disassembled Brick by Brick and reassembled in it's current location off Randolph road, where it functions as an art museum</p></p>
        <p>The first time Charlotte was seperately cenused as a seperate entity from the rest of the county, was in 1850, and it was recorded as only having 1,065 residents in its' limits.<br>
        1855 marked the first expansion of its limits, which expanded it to the grid's final size, bounded more or less by 12th street, Mcdowell street, Morehead Street and Cedar street. 
        <br> The grid was surveyed out one last time, but many of the roads, even within the orginal survey's bounds that are around today were still not on the ground. This is one of the largest challenges I have encountered. 
        <br>There are many "Ghost roads" that show up on maps of the time, that I have found no evidence to show every existed. Notably, the grid that extended past current 277 near 12 street<a href="https://web.lib.unc.edu/nc-maps/interactive/Cm912c_C47_1911b.php">This Map of Charlotte in 1877, shows what I mean</a> </p>
        <p>The 1840-50s also saw the addition of many railroads, as Charlotte is a great crossroads to connect Atlanta and the deep south with the rest of the eastern seaboard
          There was a large railyard that sat where the convention center now is, until the 1950s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The railroads, along with passionate Industrialists such as D.A. Thompkins(who also wrote several histories of the county) brought cotton and textile processing to the city. 
          <br>This marked the start of the boom of Charlotte that continues to this day. Industry popped up along the rail lines, bringing us the South end area, along with southern Noda, which steadily expanded into the 1900s
